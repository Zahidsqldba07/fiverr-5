### Web Scrapers
- bs4_scraper.py: straight-forward web scraping using Python's `BeautifulSoup` and ```requests``` packages. Fetches the HTML code and parses it, filtering out points of interests.

- selenium.py: a little more involved method of webscraping. Selenium is known for its ability to test web applications. Needed when a login is involved, or any interaction with some type of form.
